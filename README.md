Hi, I'm Iffah! Currently working as a software engineer in the sprawling industrial area in Penang, I'm keen to learn more on coding. Coming from electrical and electronics engineering background, I've set my eyes to be able to indulge in technology and its developments ever since. I'm a fast-learner, resilient in getting better in things I'm passionate about. My track records in immersing myself to be better are proven in my daily life. For that, being an absolute beginner, I'm ready to face errors and learn from it. 
I may be reached throughout my social media with the same name or email iffahrezali[at]icloud.com.
